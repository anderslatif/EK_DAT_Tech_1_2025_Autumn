# Why binary?

Why do we use binary in computers?

<details> 
  <summary>Hint</summary>
  It relates to the hardware.

# Computers are powered with electrical current

Either it is on (`1`) or off (`0`). 

Transistors (electronic switches, ON/OFF) and gates perform logical operations with binary numbers

# Binary always doubles in size

Try to sum all the numbers to the right of each bit representation. *What do you notice?*

<img src="./assets/binary_numbers.png" alt="Binary Numbers">

<details> 
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  The sum of the numbers to the right are always 1 less than the number itself. E.g., 8 - 1 = 4 + 2 + 1

# From Bits to Bytes

# Let's convert from byte to larger units

**1 byte = 8 bits**

```bash
$ ls -l
```

The values are in always shown in byte. Can you convert to kilobyte (KB), megabyte (MB), and gigabyte (GB)?

*Discuss in pairs*

# Converting bytes to larger units - Solution

**Decimal (SI) units:**

- 1 KB = 1,000 bytes
- 1 MB = 1,000 KB = 1,000,000 bytes
- 1 GB = 1,000 MB = 1,000,000,000 bytes

**Conversion formulas:**

- KB = bytes ÷ 1,000
- MB = bytes ÷ 1,000,000
- GB = bytes ÷ 1,000,000,000

    <h1>Hexadecimal (hex)</h1>
</div>

# Hexadecimal (hex)

Base 16.

Often indicated with a `0x` prefix.

Since we only have digits `0`-`9`, we use `A`-`F` to represent the values 10-15.

Hex is more readable for humans because 1 hex digit = 4 bits (since 2⁴ = 16).

*How many hex digits is needed to represent `11011011`? What does it say?*

<details> 
  <summary>Answer</summary>
   2 x 2^4 = 2 hex digits and `11011011` is represented as `DB` in hexadecimal.

# Hex Colors

|-----|-----|-----|-------|
| 255 | 255 | 255 | White | 
|  0  |  0  |  0  | Black | 

- **00** = 0 (minimum)
- **FF** = 255 (maximum)

*How do you write white and black as hex colors?* 

*Can you figure out the hex values for these colors?*

|  R  |  G  |  B  | Color | Hex Code |

# Signed vs. Unsigned Integers

In MySQL (not SQL) the keyword `UNSIGNED` can define a number type to hold only non-negative numbers. 

Many programming languages support declaring an integer as signed or unsigned. 

E.g., in C/C++ there are `int8_t` (signed) and `uint8_t` (unsigned) 8-bit integers.

| Type     | Bit Pattern           | Range       |
|----------|-----------------------|-------------|
| Signed   | [s][7][6][5][4][3][2][1] | -128 to 127 |
| Unsigned | [7][6][5][4][3][2][1][0] | 0 to 255    |

[s] = 0: positive number
[s] = 1: negative number
