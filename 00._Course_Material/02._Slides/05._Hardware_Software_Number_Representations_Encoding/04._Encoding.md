Symbols mapped to specific values (e.g. binary).

# ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Character_set

A-Z are in range 65 - 90.

a-z are in range 97 - 122.

In your browser console try the following:

```javascript
String.fromCodePoint(65) // "A"
String.fromCodePoint(97) // "a"
"b".codePointAt() // 98
```

See the next slide and answer: *What is one problem with ASCII?*

# UTF (Unicode Transformation Format)

**UTF-8**: 8 to 32 bits
**UTF-16**: 16 to 32 bits
**UTF-32**: 32 bits

If we just use 32 bits for every character, then file sizes would unnecessarily large as each character would take up 4 bytes.

`File size in bits` = `Bits per character` * `Number of characters`

That's why it's great that Unicode can have variable sizes.
