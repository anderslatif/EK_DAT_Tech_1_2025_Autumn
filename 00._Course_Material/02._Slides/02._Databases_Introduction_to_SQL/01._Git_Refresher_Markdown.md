# What commands do you remember?

Let's try it locally first. 

Make an empty folder and `cd` into it.

Then, to initialize a local repository:

```bash
$ git init
```

*Does anyone want to demo the commands?*

**Note**: You cannot push to local repositories as there is no remote to push to.

---

# Let's try it with the semester repository

*Is anyone daring enough to push a new file to it?*

---

# Git refresher

```bash
$ git clone <repository-url>
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Commit message"
$ git push
```

Remember to create changes before *staging* (adding). Otherwise, nothing gets commited if there is nothing to *stage*.

# Assignment - Collaborators

This is just a quick in-class assignment. It doesn't matter for the future who you choose as your collaborators.

1. Create a new repository titled `Test_Project_Tech_1`.
2. Go the `Settings`, top-right tab. Select `Collaborators` in the left pane. Click `Add people` and invite people sitting next to you.
3. Clone it.
4. Create a `.github` folder and add a file named `CONTRIBUTING.md`. This usually contains guidelines for contributing to the project. Add a section called `Contributors` and write the alias of the contributors (be careful of using real names because of GDPR).
5. Each person adds their own name. Before pushing **ABSOLUTELY** make sure to run `git pull`. Then push.
6. See the results on GitHub.
7. Once satisfied, delete the repository at the bottom of `Settings` -> `General`.
