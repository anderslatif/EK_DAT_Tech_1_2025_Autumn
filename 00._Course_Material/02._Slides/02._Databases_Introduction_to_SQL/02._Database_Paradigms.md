# Databases are?

A database is a collection of data stored in either:

1. File storage (e.g. MySQL = Tech1) (Utilizes memory for caching and retrieving etc.)

Persists data on disk. Restarting the database would not lose data, ideally.

2. Memory (e.g. H2 = Programming)

Volatile. Data is lost when the database is restarted.

# Ways to store data:

* **Plaintext**: `.txt`, `.csv`, `.json`, `.xml`, `.yaml`.

* **Binary**: `.exe`, `.dll`,`.jpg`, `.png`, `.avi`, `.mp4`, `.mkv`.

And many more. MySQL utilizes binary formats for storing data.

*In your Java world, can you give an example of both a plaintext file format and a binary file format?*

<details> 
  <summary>Answer</summary>
   `.java` is plaintext. `.class` files are binary.

# Sequential vs. Random Access

**Sequential**

The data is written in consecutive locations. Must run through the file from the start until the data is found:

```plaintext
007895211#Elizabeth#Jones#2036785241$506874522#Julian#Chapman#2039876455$385469983#Ian#McAlister#2051123542$096538014#Ruth#Hutchinson#2038900017%
```

**Relative/Random/Direct access**

The size of each record is fixed, allowing for direct access to any record without reading previous ones:

```plaintext
007895211Elizabeth      Jones          2036785241
506874522Julian         Chapman        2039876455
385469983Ian            McAlister      2051123542

# Indexed data - Multiple files

# Advice: Don't be stingy!

Assign sufficient space for each column. Students are often too stingy with the space.

Storage space is incredibly cheap while migrating a database (changing schemas) is troublesome and extremely costly in production.

# Database Management Systems (DBMS) (with MySQL examples):

1. Data

2. Access Interface:
  - A query language (e.g. SQL) 
  - CLI (Command-line interface) (e.g. MySQL Shell)
  - GUI (Graphical User Interface) (e.g. DataGrip, IntelliJ, MySQL Workbench)

3. Connectivity layer
  - Driver (e.g. JDBC)

4. Utilities (for instance for backup, performance / statistics tools, monitoring / logging, scheduling, access control)

# Access Interface vs. Connectivity layer

*What is the major difference between category `2` and `3` in the previous slide?*

<details> 
  <summary>Answer</summary>
   2 categorizes human interaction. 3 categorizes programmatic interface.

# Relational Databases vs. NoSQL

NoSQL is a horrible term that throws a lot of database paradigms into one category as opposed to relational databases.

# Examples of SQL databases

There are many types of SQL databases. This semester you will use MySQL but you should consider choosing a different one.

- PostgreSQL
- SQLite
- MariaDB (community-developed fork of MySQL)
- MySQL
- Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)
- Oracle Database

MySQL supports multiple storage engines such as: `InnoDB` (default), `MyISAM`, `MEMORY` and more.

While there are some syntactical differences between them, learning SQL is a transferable skill towards learning other SQL databases.
