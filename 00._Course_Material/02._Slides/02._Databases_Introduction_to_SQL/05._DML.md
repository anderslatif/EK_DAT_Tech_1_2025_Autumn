# DML: Data **Manipulation** Language

Use it to work with the data. Overview:

| CRUD | DML Command |
|------|-------------|
| **C**reate | INSERT |
| **R**ead | SELECT |
| **U**pdate | UPDATE |
| **D**elete | DELETE |

---

# INSERT

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3);
```

Can you figure out how to add data to your `games` table?

**Assignment**: Create many rows, each with varying amount of information.

---

# Insert multiple rows at once

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3),
       (value4, value5, value6),
       (value7, value8, value9);
```

*Couldn't you just have done this to solve the previous assignment?*

<details> 
  <summary>Answer</summary>
   No. This isn't for columns of variable length.

# SELECT

Only select certain columns:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, column3
FROM table_name
```

Select all columns (`*` = all):

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table_name
```

*Try it out.*

---

# The WHERE clause

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

| Operator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| > | Greater Than |
| >= | Greater than or Equal to |
| < | Less Than |
| <= | Less than or Equal to |
| = | Equal to |
| <> | Not Equal to (MySQL also supports `!=`) |
| BETWEEN | In an inclusive Range |
| LIKE | Search for a pattern |
| IN | To specify multiple possible values for a column |

**Assignment**: Ignoring the last three, try them all out.

---

# AND / OR

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2;

SELECT *
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 OR condition2;
```

**Assignment**: Try out both `AND` and `OR` with the `games` table.
