# Git is a decentralized version control system

**Origin** is the location of the server that you push to.

GitHub very conveniently provides servers that allows users to push to, pull from.

But you could set your origin to any IP address as long as the network allows you to communicate with them.

# Add and commit combine

This:

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "<commit_message>"
```

Can also be written like this:

```bash
$ git commit -am "<commit_message>"
```

This adds all changes to the commit.

The two step process allows more granularity in what to stage before committing.

---

# Checkout a previous commit

```bash
$ git log --graph
```

Commit sha:

```bash
$ git checkout <sha>
```

```bash
$ git checkout head
```

```bash
$ git checkout main
```

# Git stash

Stashing is helpful when you want to pull (requires uncommited file changes) but don't want to create a commit just yet. 

Stash (temprorarily shelve) changes:

```bash
$ git stash
```

Reapply the most recent stash:

```bash
$ git stash pop
```

It's also possible to stash by a name and apply a specific stash.

---

# When nothing else works...

> Just give me what is in the repository right now.

**Warning**: this throws away all your uncommited local changes:

```bash
$ git reset --hard origin
```
