# *nix: Everything is a file

## Warning, this and the next are difficult slide for the *real* techies

`*nix` is the family of OS that includes Unix, Linux and MacOS.

# Windows and its many terminals

- `cmd`: does **not** support what you are learning. 

- `Powershell`: aliases many *nix-type commands, which means that under the hood it runs cmdlets that return `.NET` objects (like `Get-ChildItem` = `ls`, `Get-Process` = `ps`, `Get-Content` = `cat`)

- `Git Bash`: provides POSIX environment that only aliases when necessary.

- `Cygwin`: a large collection of GNU and Open Source tools which provide functionality similar to a Linux distribution on Windows.

* `Windows Subsystem for Linux` (`WSL`): provides a *nix experience by running a Linux distribution.
