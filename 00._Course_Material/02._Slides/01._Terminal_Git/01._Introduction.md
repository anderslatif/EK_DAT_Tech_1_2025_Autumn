# Don't use AI at all during class or for any exercises

If you are stuck on an exercise in class, discuss with your classmates. 

Use old-school search engines to help you with exercises outside of class. This will help you develop the correct terminology.

The goal of an exercise is really not for you to solve it, it is for you to learn from it. 

It is more valuable that you struggle with a problem yourself without ever solving it compared to having AI generate the solution.
