# Starter Template

It's more fun if you use your own schema but here is starter template if you need it: 

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS games (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    release_date DATE NOT NULL,
    rating SMALLINT,
    price INT
);

INSERT INTO games (title, release_date, rating, price) VALUES
('The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild', '2017-03-03', 10, 5999),
('Super Mario Odyssey', '2017-10-27', 9, 5999),
('Animal Crossing: New Horizons', '2020-03-20', 9, 4999),
('Metroid Dread', '2021-10-08', 1, 5999),
('Splatoon 3', '2022-09-09', 1, 5999),
('Hollow Knight: Silksong', '2023-02-24', 1, 4999),
('Life Is Strange', '2015-01-30', 10, 1999)
```
