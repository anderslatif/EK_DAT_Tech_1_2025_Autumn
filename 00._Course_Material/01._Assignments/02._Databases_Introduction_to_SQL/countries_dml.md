# Countries (DML)

Solve the classroom assign

The purpose is for you to master the basic SQL commands you've learned so far.

You are given an SQL file called [countries.sql](./countries.sql).

0. The `INSERT` statements are out of order. Can you sort them? (Not a SQL question but relates to week 1). You are allowed to temporarily cut out the top first and readd them.

1. Run the SQL file so that a new database is created named `world_countries`.

2. How many countries are there? How did you find out?

3. Lots of countries are missing; add a couple. For every statement do not copy or look at the previous statement. Try to see if you can write the proper syntax from scratch.

4. Add more columns to the database as you see fit.

5. Add even more countries but this time using more information by utilizing the new columns.

6. **Bonus question**: Delete 'Langbortistan' from the database. (We didn't go through how to do this, but perhaps you can look it up online).
